A production-grade multi-agent system for comprehensive medical diagnosis and coding using specialized AI agents.


## Installation

```bash
pip install mcs
```

## Usage

```python

from mcs.main import MedicalCoderSwarm
import json

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Example patient case
  patient_case = """
  Patient: 45-year-old White Male
  Location: New York, NY

  Lab Results:
  - egfr 
  - 59 ml / min / 1.73
  - non african-american
  
  """
  
  swarm = MedicalCoderSwarm(patient_id="Patient-001", max_loops=1, patient_documentation="")
  
  swarm.run(task=patient_case)
  
  print(json.dumps(swarm.to_dict()))
```


## Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    CMO[Chief Medical Officer] --> V[Virologist]
    V --> I[Internist]
    I --> MC[Medical Coder]
    MC --> S[Synthesizer]
    
```

## Features

- **Specialized Agent Roles**: Each agent has specific medical expertise and responsibilities
- **Structured Diagnostic Flow**: Organized pipeline from initial assessment to final synthesis
- **ICD-10 Coding Integration**: Comprehensive medical coding at each diagnostic stage
- **Automated Report Generation**: Standardized medical and coding reports
- **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Multi-stage verification and synthesis process

## Lab Range Analysis

The system includes specialized functionality for analyzing lab results against diagnostic criteria:

- Automated range checking for common tests (e.g., eGFR)
- Diagnosis-specific range validation
- Multi-factor analysis for complex diagnoses
